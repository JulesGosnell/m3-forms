# m3-forms

An experimental JSON editor built on [m3](https://github.com/jules-gosnell/m3) — a JSON Schema validator supporting all drafts from draft-3 through draft-next.

m3-forms uses JSON Schema as the basis for automatically generating form-based editors at multiple meta-levels (M3 meta-schema, M2 schema, M1 data, M0 templates).
